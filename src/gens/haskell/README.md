- `Bool` — represented as `Bool`.
- `Int32` — represented as `Int32`.
- `Int64` — represented as `Int64`.
- `Float32` — represented as `Float`.
- `Float64` — represented as `Double`.
- `String` — represented as `String`.
- `Option<T>` — represented as `Maybe T`.
- `Vec<T>` — represented as `[T]`.
- `Map<K, V>` — represented as `Map K V`.
- `Struct` — represented as a data type.
- `Enum` — represented as an algebraic data type.
- `OneOf` — represented as an algebraic data type with each variant as its own data type.
